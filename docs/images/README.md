# The README's pictures

The pictures of the repository's [README](../../README.md), made from the app's own screenshots:

| File | What it shows | Made from |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `console.png` | The home, landscape on an iPhone 17 Pro | The gallery's `iphone-home-landscape`, in English |
| `screens.png` | All games, a game paused behind the console, a game's settings | The gallery's `iphone-library`, `iphone-home-paused` and `iphone-game-settings`, in English |
| `builder.png` | Cartouche Builder's library | The Builder's gallery, `library-en-light` |
| `icon.png` | Cartouche's icon, with the corners iOS gives it | [`app/icon`](../../app/icon/) |
| `download-*.png` | The download buttons | Drawn for the README |

The screenshots are the ones CI takes of every screen: the Launcher screens workflow, with `"language": "en"` in [`launcher/Gallery/scenarios.json`](../../launcher/Gallery/scenarios.json), for the app, and the Builder workflow for Cartouche Builder. Each phone is drawn around its screenshot on Cartouche's colours, at twice its size in points.

The games show their official covers, as in the app, which loads them from IGDB ([decision 83](../decisions.md)). Never an image from inside a game: no capture of a game running, and no game's screenshot. The download buttons link to the [download page](https://clabeuhtegrite.github.io/Cartouche/download/), which gives the newest file, and say no version.
